# ThreadedBinaryTrees

Doubly Threaded Binary Trees use the null pointers present in nodes efficiently to point to their successors & predecessors. 
Thus making traversal faster & saving space.

We have implemented the same in C language with all basic functionalities like Insert, Delete, Inorder Traversal & Display.
